Design Patterns are typically split into 3 categories
This is called Gamma categorisation, after Erich Gamma, one of GoF authors

1. Creational Patterns
 - Deal with creation (construction) of objects
 - Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
 - Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step)

2. Structural Patterns
 - Cencerned with the structure (e.g. class members)
 - Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface
 - Stress the importance of good API design

3. Behavioral Patterns
 - They are all different; no central theme
